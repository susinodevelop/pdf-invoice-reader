Invoice request validation utilities.

In a full implementation this module would include Pydantic models and
custom validation functions to ensure incoming requests meet the
expected schema (e.g. number of files, file sizes, asesoria naming
conventions). Here we simply define a placeholder function to
illustrate where such logic would reside.
